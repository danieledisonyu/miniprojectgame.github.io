		<div class="t3"><h4>In 2016, KOG Studios announced a mobile game made by themselves. KOG Studios and Kakao Games released the game Grand Chase for kakao at September 2017 as closed beta and officially released it at January 2018. In July 2018, the game was released internationally and renamed Grand Chase: Dimensional Chaser, first released in the Philippines and later in Japan. The Japanese and Philippine servers use Japanese voice-overs. 
        The game serves as the sequel for the PC game and introduced new characters and setting. The game has different mechanics compared to the original game. The player has to use a team of up to four characters with different classes to run dungeons and defeat monsters and bosses strategically. </h4></div></div>

			<div class="t3"><h4>The story focuses on the adventure of the Grand Chase group originally by Elesis, Lire, and Arme, who depart from the region of Bermesiah to hunt down the evil queen Kaze'aze who was cause of a civil war between two of Bermesiah's kingdoms, Serdin and Kanavan. </h4><div class="img"><img src="images/map.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/dungeon.jpg" width="265" height="183"></div></div>

          <div class="t2"><h2>Characters</h2></div>
	      <div class="t3"><h4>Initially, there were three main characters available: the knight Elesis, the magician Arme, and the elven archer Lire. More characters were added to the available roster with subsequent updates, each adding a different playstyle from the rest, and were unlockable by performing difficult free missions or by buying the character with real money. The final version of Grand Chase included 20 playable characters</h4><div class="img"><img src="images/chars.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/chars2.png" width="310" height="174"></div></div>

	      <div class="t3"><h4>Players could also compete against each other in combat. There were two types of player versus player combat in Grand Chase: Team Battles and Survival, with additional options of choosing between Tag and Fight, No Item and Item Mode. Win/loss statistics were recorded for these matches. 
Team battles consisted of two, four, or six players and can be played in one-, two-, and three-a-side formations. Each player was given the option to join either the Serdin Team or Kanavan Team, although they could not change sides during a match. Team battles encouraged players to plan their attack strategies and co-operate with one another to defeat the opposing team. </h4><div class="img"><img src="images/pvp1.jpg">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/pvp.jpg" width="248" height="183"></div></div>
